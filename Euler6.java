   * Name: David Johnson

   * Version: 1.0
   * Purpose of program (quoted from projecteuler.net):
   * The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
   * 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
   * The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
   * (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
   * Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten
   *   natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
   * Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one
   *   hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
   *   
   * This one was really easy so I went with the obvious brute_force answer
